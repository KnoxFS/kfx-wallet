## What is KnoxFS?

Knox is a proof-of-stake blockchain that provides instant and secure transactions across its network. Knox has a primary focus on secure data storage and sharing achieved by using proven encryption methods and technologies and a distributed network built on IPFS and custom built protocols.

## What is the goal of the project?

We believe there is an incredible need for increased and enhanced privacy with regard to data storage, access, and trust.  We're working towards a goal of making distributed storage not only easy to access, use and manage for the everyday person but also secure and easily shared with trusted parties.  Currently, user data is commercialized and shopped around and we're aiming to put the people's data back in the hands of the people by providing a better alternative to common tools provided by massive corporations such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.  Data breaches foster a valid fear and are a threat daily to the security and privacy of your information.  Eliminating these centralized services with a more distributed approach is not only ideal, but essential.

## Multi-tiered masternodes

To make participating in providing network services attainable by everyone we're using a multi-tiered masternode model. Each level has different collateral requirements associated with it, as well as rewards. That structure is outlined below:

### Tier-1 masternode

**Collateral:** 30,000 KFX
**Reward:** 4 KFX per block

### Tier-2 masternode

**Collateral:** 50,000 KFX
**Reward:** 10 KFX per block

### Tier-3 masternode

**Collateral:** 70,000 KFX
**Reward:** 16 KFX per block
